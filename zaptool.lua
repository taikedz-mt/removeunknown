-- ========= Perform inventory item replacement

-- TODO can we do an interation over the player's inventory?
-- might need to be a tool which on use performs the action, so as not to be parsing inventories evey second
-- define a global "if no replacement defined" that gives a default item. Could be itemstakc, new tool, currency, etc
